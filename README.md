# data_feature
Data feature engineering for time series data. (1) data authenticity judgment: the overall trend, periodicity, peak and trough of the data can be observed through excel, or the authenticity of the data can be verified by means of fitting technology.(2) data outlier processing: for NAN data or singularity, data outlier processing based on rayda criterion can be adopted.About the principle of la IDA criterion, everybody baidu is ok.I'm just going to say it briefly is when the sample deviation of a sample point is greater than 3 standard deviations.(3) data denoising smoothing processing: in order to avoid interference caused by noise as much as possible, commonly used denoising technologies include sliding average filtering, low-pass high-pass filtering, median filtering, kalman filtering, wavelet threshold filtering, etc.(4) data segmentation: the commonly used items include sliding window based, threshold based detection, model matching, etc.(5) data feature extraction: divided into three categories: time-domain feature, frequency-domain feature and time-frequency feature.Time domain features include: maximum, minimum, variance, standard deviation, RMSE, mean, information entropy, etc.Frequency domain features include the output of FFT(bias coefficients), spectral distribution, and the sum of FFT coefficients squared.Time-frequency domain features include wavelet decomposition, wavelet packet decomposition and reconstruction.
